# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
We are tasked with completion of an election audit for a recent local congressional election. Under this audit, we will research the following:

* How many votes were cast in the election
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes cast for each county in the precinct
* Which county had the largest number of votes
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received
* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what their percentage of the total votes

## Election Audit Results

The analysis of the election show that

* There were a grand total of 369,711 votes in this election
* The voting breakdown for each county in the precinct is as follows:
  * Jefferson County received 38,855 total votes, resulting in 10.5% of the total votes cast
  * Denver County received 306,055 total votes, resulting in 82.8% of the total votes cast
  * Arapahoe County received 24,801 total votes, resulting in 6.7$ of the total votes cast
* Denver County recieved the largest amount of votes in the election
* The voting breakdown for each candidate who received a vote is as follows:
  * Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 total votes, resulting in 23% of the total votes cast
  * Diana DeGette received 272,892 total votes, resulting in 73.8% of the total votes cast
  * Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 total votes, resulting in 3.1% of the total votes cast
* The winner of this election is Diana DeGette, with 272,892 total votes, which is 73.8% of the votes cast

## Election Audit Summary

Using this script, we can modify it to be used for any election. For instance, uploading another precinct's election results csv into a similar script will grant us the same analysis, but with their results. Also, if we were to have access for each candidates political party, we could be able to show which political party won the election, as well as how each political party did in each county.
